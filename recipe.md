For tomato mixture: Heat olive oil in a small skillet or saucepan, add garlic and saute until just starting to turn golden.
Pour into a large mixing bowl and let cool while you chop the tomatoes and basil.
Pour tomatoes into the bowl with cooled oil mixture. Add parmesan, basil, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper. Toss mixture well. Serve right away over toasted bread and garnish with more parmesan if desired.
To toast bread: Align bread slices on an 18-by-13-inch baking sheet. Broil the first side until golden brown, then flip slices to the opposite side and broil opposite side until golden brown.
