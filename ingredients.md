Extra virgin olive oil – I prefer extra virgin olive oil but regular olive oil will work too, along with any other oils of your choice
Minced fresh garlic – Make sure the garlic is minced not chopped, as minced has a more intense flavor you won’t want to miss.
Roma tomatoes – These are full of flavor with a tangy, garden-fresh tomato taste that’s best for making bruschetta.
Balsamic vinegar – An essential ingredient for that authentic bruschetta taste.
Kosher salt – You can use regular salt as a replacement if you don’t have or can’t find kosher salt.
Black pepper – Adds a little bit of spice that helps bring out the flavors along with the salt.
Basil ribbons – Fresh basil really pulls the whole flavor combo together
French bread – When sliced and toasted its the best crispy texture for this recipe
Finely shredded parmesan cheese – Try fresh parmesan to really get an all-over fresh recipe you’ll love.
